// Loops allow us to repeat actions

// "For loops" are if we know how many times we want to do an action
// Count one to ten

for (let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
  console.log(i + ", hahaha");
}

// "While loops" are if we want to take a set of actions, but don't know when that will happen

while (stillAlive) {
  // Play the game
  console.log("did action 1");

  //   50 loop sinto th game
  console.log("You fell into lava");
