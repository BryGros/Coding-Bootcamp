CSS:

Selectors (the particular element tag or id/class we're making changes to)
- If it's a stylization of an element in every instance, it is just the element tag (e.g., h1 or p)
- If it's a zoom in to a specific class of elements, use .class to select 
- If it's a single instance of styling, use the element id by using the #id Selectors
- Syntax
    - Attribute: stylization;


HTML Forms
- Fields (mostly "inputs")
    - Have a name and an ID
    - Labels share with the ID
    - Inputs can have attributes to make them required, max/min length, match styles, types
